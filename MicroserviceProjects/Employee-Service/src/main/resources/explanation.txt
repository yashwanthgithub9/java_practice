That is the "Million Dollar Question" of System Design.

You are right—it feels redundant. Why run the exact same code twice on the same machine?

In a Developer Environment (on your laptop), it is just for show. But in a Production Environment (Real World), running multiple instances of the "Same Code" is the only way to solve the two biggest problems in software: Crashing and Traffic.

Here is why you need it, explained with a "Supermarket" analogy.

1. Fault Tolerance (The "Sick Cashier" Problem)
Imagine your supermarket has only one cashier (Port 8080).

Scenario: That cashier gets sick (The application crashes, runs out of memory, or needs a restart).

Result: The entire supermarket closes. No one can buy anything. The business loses money.

With your new setup (Clustering):

You have two cashiers (8080 and 8082) doing the exact same job.

Scenario: Cashier 8080 crashes.

Result: The Gateway (Manager) notices 8080 is unresponsive and immediately sends the next customer to 8082. The customer doesn't even know something went wrong.

2. Scalability (The "Black Friday" Problem)
Scenario: It is Black Friday. 10,000 customers try to check out at once.

Single Instance (8080): It gets overwhelmed, slows down, and eventually freezes.

Multiple Instances (8080, 8082, 8083...): The Gateway distributes the crowd. 5,000 go to one, 5,000 go to the other. The system stays fast.

The "Kill Test" (Let's Prove It)
You have built a system that is "Indestructible." Let's prove it right now.

Verify both are running: Ensure Eureka shows (2) instances.

The "Crash": Go to IntelliJ and STOP the original EmployeeServiceApplication (Port 8080). Leave the 8082 version running.

The Test: Go to Postman and hit the Gateway URL (localhost:9191/employees/1) again.

What happens?

If you had a normal app: You would get Error: Connection Refused.

With your Architecture: The Gateway will see 8080 is dead, reroute you to 8082, and (even though 8082 might say "User not found" because its H2 database is empty), the Server will respond.

You just survived a server crash. That is why we run the same code twice.
