f a hacker changes "Yashwanth" to "Admin" inside the token,
the Wax Seal (Signature) shatters.
Why? The Math Behind the MagicThe signature isn't just a random stamp.
It is calculated using a strict formula:
$$Signature = Hash(Header + Payload + SecretKey)
$$Original Token:Payload: "Yashwanth"Secret:
"MySecretKey"Result: Signature "ABC"
Hacked Token:Payload: "Admin" (Changed!)Secret: "MySecretKey" (Hacker doesn't know this, so he can't calculate a new signature).
Result: The math requires the signature to be "XYZ".Reality:
The token still has the old signature "ABC".
The Validation (parseClaimsJws):The system runs the math: "For payload 'Admin', I expect signature 'XYZ'."It looks at the token: "This token has signature 'ABC'.
"Mismatch! -> CRASH (SignatureException).
This is why JWTs are so powerful.
You can hand them to the client (browser), and you don't have to worry about them cheating.
