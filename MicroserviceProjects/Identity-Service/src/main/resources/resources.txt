f a hacker changes "Yashwanth" to "Admin" inside the token,
the Wax Seal (Signature) shatters.
Why? The Math Behind the MagicThe signature isn't just a random stamp.
It is calculated using a strict formula:
$$Signature = Hash(Header + Payload + SecretKey)
$$Original Token:Payload: "Yashwanth"Secret:
"MySecretKey"Result: Signature "ABC"
Hacked Token:Payload: "Admin" (Changed!)Secret: "MySecretKey" (Hacker doesn't know this, so he can't calculate a new signature).
Result: The math requires the signature to be "XYZ".Reality:
The token still has the old signature "ABC".
The Validation (parseClaimsJws):The system runs the math: "For payload 'Admin', I expect signature 'XYZ'."It looks at the token: "This token has signature 'ABC'.
"Mismatch! -> CRASH (SignatureException).
This is why JWTs are so powerful.
You can hand them to the client (browser), and you don't have to worry about them cheating.


The AuthConfig class is the configuration center. It tells Spring Security:

"Use my custom logic" (UserDetailsService) instead of the default logic.

"Use this Password Encoder" (BCrypt) to encrypt passwords.
